## Install

```bash
# npm (recommended)
npm install -g @altimateai/altimate-code

# Homebrew
brew install AltimateAI/tap/altimate-code
```

Then — in order:

**Step 1: Configure your LLM provider** (required before anything works):
```bash
altimate        # Launch the TUI
/connect        # Interactive setup — choose your provider and enter your API key
```

> **No API key?** Select **Codex** in the `/connect` menu — it's built-in and requires no setup.

Or set an environment variable directly:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key   # Anthropic Claude
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key      # OpenAI
```

**Step 2 (optional): Auto-detect your data stack** (read-only, safe for production connections):
```bash
altimate /discover
```

`/discover` auto-detects dbt projects, warehouse connections (from `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`, Docker, environment variables), and installed tools (dbt, sqlfluff, airflow, dagster, and more). Skip this and start building — you can always run it later.

> **Zero Python setup required.** On first run, the CLI automatically downloads [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), creates an isolated Python environment, and installs the data engine with all warehouse drivers. No `pip install`, no virtualenv management.

## Why a specialized harness?

General AI coding agents can edit SQL files. They cannot *understand* your data stack.
altimate gives any LLM a deterministic data engineering intelligence layer —
no hallucinated SQL advice, no guessing at schema, no missed PII.

| Capability | General coding agents | altimate |
|---|---|---|
| SQL anti-pattern detection | None | 19 rules, confidence-scored |
| Column-level lineage | None | Automatic from SQL, any dialect |
| Schema-aware autocomplete | None | Live-indexed warehouse metadata |
| Cross-dialect SQL translation | None | Snowflake ↔ BigQuery ↔ Databricks ↔ Redshift |
| FinOps & cost analysis | None | Credits, expensive queries, right-sizing |
| PII detection | None | 30+ regex patterns, 15 categories |
| dbt integration | Basic file editing | Manifest parsing, test gen, model scaffolding, lineage |
| Data visualization | None | Auto-generated charts from SQL results |
| Observability | None | Local-first tracing of AI sessions and tool calls |

> **Benchmarked precision:** 100% F1 on SQL anti-pattern detection (1,077 queries, 19 rules, 0 false positives).
> 100% edge-match on column-level lineage (500 queries, 13 categories).
> [See methodology →](experiments/BENCHMARKS.md)

**What the harness provides:**
- **SQL Intelligence Engine** — deterministic SQL parsing and analysis (not LLM pattern matching). 19 rules, 100% F1, 0 false positives. Built for data engineers who've been burned by hallucinated SQL advice.
- **Column-Level Lineage** — automatic extraction from SQL across dialects. 100% edge-match on 500 benchmark queries.
- **Live Warehouse Intelligence** — indexed schemas, query history, and cost data from your actual warehouse. Not guesses.
- **dbt Native** — manifest parsing, test generation, model scaffolding, medallion patterns, impact analysis
- **FinOps** — credit consumption, expensive query detection, warehouse right-sizing, idle resource cleanup
- **PII Detection** — 15 categories, 30+ regex patterns, enforced pre-execution

**Works seamlessly with Claude Code and Codex.** altimate is the data engineering tool layer — use it standalone in your terminal, or mount it as the harness underneath whatever AI agent you already run. The two are complementary.

altimate is a fork of [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) rebuilt for data teams. Model-agnostic — bring your own LLM or run locally with Ollama.

## Quick demo

```bash
# Auto-detect your data stack (dbt projects, warehouse connections, installed tools)
> /discover

# Analyze a query for anti-patterns and optimization opportunities
> Analyze this query for issues: SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.id = customers.order_id

# Translate SQL across dialects
> /sql-translate this Snowflake query to BigQuery: SELECT DATEADD(day, 7, current_date())

# Generate dbt tests for a model
> /generate-tests for models/staging/stg_orders.sql

# Get a cost report for your Snowflake account
> /cost-report
```

## Key Features

All features are deterministic — they parse, trace, and measure. Not LLM pattern matching.

### SQL Anti-Pattern Detection
19 rules with confidence scoring — catches SELECT *, cartesian joins, non-sargable predicates, correlated subqueries, and more. **100% accuracy** on 1,077 benchmark queries.

### Column-Level Lineage
Automatic lineage extraction from SQL. Trace any column back through joins, CTEs, and subqueries to its source. Works standalone or with dbt manifests for project-wide lineage. **100% edge match** on 500 benchmark queries.

### FinOps & Cost Analysis
Credit analysis, expensive query detection, warehouse right-sizing, unused resource cleanup, and RBAC auditing.

### Cross-Dialect Translation
Transpile SQL between Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and DuckDB.

### PII Detection & Safety
Automatic column scanning for PII across 15 categories with 30+ regex patterns. Safety checks and policy enforcement before query execution.

### dbt Native
Manifest parsing, test generation, model scaffolding, incremental model detection, and lineage-aware refactoring. 11 purpose-built skills including medallion patterns, yaml config generation, and dbt docs.

## Agent Modes

Each agent has scoped permissions and purpose-built tools for its role.

| Agent | Role | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Builder** | Create dbt models, SQL pipelines, and data transformations | Full read/write |
| **Analyst** | Explore data, run SELECT queries, and generate insights | Read-only enforced |
| **Validator** | Data quality checks, schema validation, test coverage analysis | Read + validate |
| **Migrator** | Cross-warehouse SQL translation, schema migration, dialect conversion | Read/write for migrations |
| **Researcher** | Deep-dive analysis, documentation research, and knowledge extraction | Read-only |
| **Trainer** | Teach project-specific patterns, naming conventions, and best practices | Read + write training data |
| **Executive** | Business-audience summaries — translates findings into revenue, cost, and compliance impact | Read-only |

> **New to altimate?** Start with **Analyst mode** — it's read-only and safe to run against production connections.

## Skills

altimate ships with built-in skills for every common data engineering task — type `/` in the TUI to browse available skills and get autocomplete. No memorization required.

## Architecture

```
altimate (TypeScript CLI)
        |
   @altimateai/altimate-core (napi-rs → Rust)
   SQL analysis, lineage, PII, safety — 45 functions, ~2ms per call
        |
   Native Node.js drivers
   10 warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Databricks,
   Redshift, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, DuckDB, SQLite
```

The CLI handles AI interactions, TUI, and tool orchestration. SQL analysis is powered by the Rust-based `@altimateai/altimate-core` engine via napi-rs bindings (no Python required). Database connectivity uses native Node.js drivers with lazy loading.

**No Python dependency**: All 73 tool methods run natively in TypeScript. No pip, venv, or Python installation needed.

**dbt-first**: When working in a dbt project, the CLI automatically uses dbt's connection from `profiles.yml` — no separate warehouse configuration needed.

### Monorepo structure

```
packages/
  altimate-code/       TypeScript CLI (main entry point)
  drivers/             Shared database drivers (10 warehouses)
  dbt-tools/           dbt integration (TypeScript)
  plugin/              Plugin system
  sdk/                 SDKs (includes VS Code extension)
  util/                Shared utilities
```

## Validation

The `/validate` skill lets you audit past AI agent sessions against a set of quality criteria — checking whether the agent's reasoning, tool calls, and final response were correct, grounded, and complete. It pulls conversation traces from the backend, runs them through an evaluation pipeline, and reports per-criterion pass/fail results with details.

You can validate:
- **A single trace**: `/validate <trace_id> or /validate the trace <trace-id>`
- **All traces in a session**: `/validate --session-id <session_id> or /validate all the traces in session id <session-id>`
- **A date range for a user**: `/validate --from <datetime> --to <datetime> --user-id <user_id> or /validate for user id <user id> for <relative duration>/ from <start date time> to <end date time>`

### Setup

**1. Register your API key**

```bash
altimate-code validate configure --api-key <your-key>
```

The api key is got from your altimate account API KEY.

**2. That's it** — the skill files are installed automatically the next time you start `altimate-code`.

To verify the installation:

```bash
altimate-code validate status
```

To install manually without restarting:

```bash
altimate-code validate install
```

### What happens if you skip configuration

If you run `/validate` without configuring an API key first, the validation script will exit immediately with:

```
ERROR: Altimate credentials not found.
Run: altimate validate configure --api-key <key>
```

No traces will be validated and nothing will be written. You must run `altimate-code validate configure` at least once before using the skill.

## Data Collection

Altimate Code logs conversation turns (prompt, tool calls, and assistant response) to improve validation quality and agent behavior. Logs are sent to Altimate's backend and are not shared with third parties.

**To opt out:**

```bash
export ALTIMATE_LOGGER_DISABLED=true
```

Add it to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) to make it permanent.

See [`docs/docs/configure/logging.md`](docs/docs/configure/logging.md) for details on what is collected.
