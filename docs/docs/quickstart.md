---

# Quickstart

> **You need:** npm 8+ or Homebrew. An API key for any supported LLM provider — or use Codex (built-in, no key required).

---

## Step 1 — Install

```bash
# npm (recommended)
npm install -g @altimateai/altimate-code

# Homebrew
brew install AltimateAI/tap/altimate-code
```

> **Zero Python setup required.** On first run, the CLI automatically downloads `uv`, creates an isolated Python environment, and installs the data engine. No `pip install`, no virtualenv management.

---

## Step 2 — Configure Your LLM

```bash
altimate        # Launch the TUI
/connect        # Choose your provider and enter your API key
```

Or set an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here   # Anthropic Claude (recommended)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here      # OpenAI
```

Minimal config file option (`altimate-code.json` in your project root):

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "your-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

> **No API key?** Select **Codex** in the `/connect` menu — it's a built-in provider with no setup required.

---

## Step 3 — Connect Your Warehouse _(Optional)_

> Skip this step if you want to work locally or don't need warehouse/orchestration connections. You can always run `/discover` later.

```bash
altimate /discover
```

`/discover` scans for dbt projects, warehouse credentials (from `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`, environment variables, and Docker), and installed tools. It **reads but never writes** — safe to run against production.

**No cloud warehouse?** Use DuckDB with a local file:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "local": {
      "type": "duckdb",
      "database": "~/.altimate/local.duckdb"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Build Your First Artifact

In the TUI, try these prompts or describe your own use case:

```

Look at my snowflake account and do a comprehensive Analysis our Snowflake credit consumption over the last 30 days. After doing this generate a dashboard for my consumption.

```

```

Build me a real time, interactive dashboard for my macbook system metrics and health. Use python, iceberg, dbt for various time slices.

```
