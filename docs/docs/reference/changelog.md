## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Smooth streaming mode for TUI response rendering (#281)
- Ship builtin skills to customers via postinstall (#279)

- Suppress console logging that corrupts TUI display (#269)

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Script to build and run compiled binary locally (#262)

### Fixed

- Snowflake auth — support all auth methods (`password`, `keypair`, `externalbrowser`, `oauth`), fix field name mismatches (#268)
- dbt tool regression — schema format mismatch, silent failures, wrong results (#263)
- `altimate-dbt compile`, `execute`, and children commands fail with runtime errors (#255)
- `Cannot find module @altimateai/altimate-core` on `npm install` (#259)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-18

### Breaking Changes

- **Python engine eliminated** — all 73 tool methods now run natively in TypeScript. No Python, pip, venv, or `altimate-engine` installation required. Fixes #210.

### Added

- `@altimateai/drivers` shared workspace package with 10 database drivers (Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Databricks, Redshift, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, DuckDB, SQLite)
- Direct `@altimateai/altimate-core` napi-rs bindings — SQL analysis calls go straight to Rust (no Python intermediary)
- dbt-first SQL execution — automatically uses `profiles.yml` connection when in a dbt project
- Warehouse telemetry (5 event types: connect, query, introspection, discovery, census)
- 340+ new tests including E2E tests against live Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks accounts
- Encrypted key-pair auth support for Snowflake (PKCS8 PEM with passphrase)
- Comprehensive driver documentation at `docs/docs/drivers.md`

### Fixed

- Python bridge connection failures for UV, conda, and non-standard venv setups (#210)
- SQL injection in finops/schema queries (parameterized queries + escape utility)
- Credential store no longer saves plaintext passwords
- SSH tunnel cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Race condition in connection registry for concurrent access
- Databricks DATE_SUB syntax
- Redshift describeTable column name
- SQL Server describeTable includes views
- Dispatcher telemetry wrapped in try/catch
- Flaky test timeouts

### Removed

- `packages/altimate-engine/` — entire Python package (~17,000 lines)
- `packages/opencode/src/altimate/bridge/` — JSON-RPC bridge
- `.github/workflows/publish-engine.yml` — PyPI publish workflow

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
