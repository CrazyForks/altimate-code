# Getting Started

> **New to altimate?** [Start with the 5-minute quickstart](quickstart.md) to go from install to your first analysis in minutes.

## Why altimate?

altimate is the open-source data engineering harness — 99+ deterministic tools for building, validating, optimizing, and shipping data products. Unlike general-purpose coding agents, every tool is purpose-built for data engineering:

| Capability | General coding agents | altimate |
|---|---|---|
| SQL anti-pattern detection | None | 19 rules with confidence scoring |
| Column-level lineage | None | Automatic from SQL |
| Schema-aware autocomplete | None | Indexes your warehouse metadata |
| Cross-dialect translation | None | Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift |
| FinOps analysis | None | Credit analysis, expensive queries, warehouse sizing |
| PII detection | None | Automatic column scanning |
| dbt integration | Basic file editing | Manifest parsing, test generation, model scaffolding |

## Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install -g altimate-code
```

After install, you'll see a welcome banner with quick-start commands. On upgrades, the banner also shows what changed since your previous version.

## Step 2: Connect Your LLM (`/connect`)

Before anything else, connect an LLM provider. Launch altimate and run:

```bash
altimate
```

> **Note:** `altimate-code` still works as a backward-compatible alias.

Then in the TUI:

```
/connect
```

This walks you through selecting and authenticating with an LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Codex, Ollama, etc.). You need a working LLM connection before the agent can do anything useful.

## Step 3: Configure Your Warehouse

Set up warehouse connections so altimate can query your data platform. You have two options:

### Option A: Auto-discover with `/discover`

```
/discover
```

`/discover` scans your environment and sets up everything automatically:

1. **Detects your dbt project** — finds `dbt_project.yml`, parses the manifest, and reads profiles
2. **Discovers warehouse connections** — from `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`, running Docker containers, and environment variables (e.g. `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `PGHOST`, `DATABASE_URL`)
3. **Checks installed tools** — dbt, sqlfluff, airflow, dagster, prefect, soda, sqlmesh, great_expectations, sqlfmt
4. **Offers to configure connections** — walks you through adding and testing each discovered warehouse
5. **Indexes schemas** — populates the schema cache for autocomplete and context-aware analysis

Once complete, altimate indexes your schemas and detects your tooling, enabling schema-aware autocomplete and context-rich analysis.

### Option B: Manual configuration

Add a warehouse connection to your `altimate-code.json`. Here are minimal snippets for each warehouse type:

#### Snowflake (quick-connect)

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "snowflake": {
      "type": "snowflake",
      "account": "xy12345.us-east-1",
      "user": "your_user",
      "password": "${SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}",
      "warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH",
      "database": "ANALYTICS"
    }
  }
}
```

#### BigQuery (quick-connect)

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "bigquery": {
      "type": "bigquery",
      "project": "my-gcp-project",
      "dataset": "analytics"
    }
  }
}
```

> Tip: Omit `service_account` to use Application Default Credentials (`gcloud auth application-default login`).

#### Databricks (quick-connect)

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "databricks": {
      "type": "databricks",
      "host": "dbc-abc123.cloud.databricks.com",
      "token": "${DATABRICKS_TOKEN}",
      "warehouse_id": "abcdef1234567890",
      "catalog": "main"
    }
  }
}
```

#### DuckDB (quick-connect)

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "duckdb": {
      "type": "duckdb",
      "database": "./dev.duckdb"
    }
  }
}
```

See [Warehouse connections](#warehouse-connections) below for full configuration options including key-pair auth, Redshift, and PostgreSQL.

## Step 4: Choose an Agent Mode

altimate offers specialized agent modes for different workflows:

| What do you want to do? | Use this agent mode |
|---|---|
| Analyzing data without risk of changes | **Analyst** — read-only queries, cost analysis, data profiling |
| Building or generating dbt models | **Builder** — model scaffolding, SQL generation, ref() wiring |
| Validating data quality | **Validator** — test generation, anomaly detection, data contracts |
| Migrating across warehouses | **Migrator** — cross-dialect SQL translation, compatibility checks |
| Teaching team conventions | **Trainer** — learns corrections, enforces naming/style rules across team |
| Research and exploration | **Researcher** — deep-dive analysis, lineage tracing, impact assessment |
| Executive summaries and reports | **Executive** — high-level overviews, cost summaries, health dashboards |

Switch modes in the TUI:

```
/mode analyst
```

## Step 5: Start Working

You are ready to go. Type a natural-language prompt in the TUI and the agent will use the appropriate tools to answer. See [Example prompts](#example-prompts) at the bottom of this page for ideas.

## Configuration

altimate uses a JSON config file. Create `altimate-code.json` in your project root or `~/.config/altimate-code/altimate-code.json` globally.

### Warehouse connections

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "prod-snowflake": {
      "type": "snowflake",
      "account": "xy12345.us-east-1",
      "user": "analytics_user",
      "password": "${SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}",
      "warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH",
      "database": "ANALYTICS",
      "role": "ANALYST_ROLE"
    },
    "dev-duckdb": {
      "type": "duckdb",
      "database": "./dev.duckdb"
    }
  }
}
```

### Snowflake (key-pair auth)

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "snowflake-prod": {
      "type": "snowflake",
      "account": "xy12345.us-east-1",
      "user": "svc_altimate",
      "private_key_path": "~/.ssh/snowflake_rsa_key.p8",
      "warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH",
      "database": "ANALYTICS",
      "role": "SYSADMIN"
    }
  }
}
```

### BigQuery

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "bigquery-prod": {
      "type": "bigquery",
      "project": "my-gcp-project",
      "dataset": "analytics",
      "service_account": "/path/to/service-account.json"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use Application Default Credentials (ADC) — just omit `service_account` and run `gcloud auth application-default login`.

### Databricks

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "databricks-prod": {
      "type": "databricks",
      "host": "dbc-abc123.cloud.databricks.com",
      "token": "${DATABRICKS_TOKEN}",
      "warehouse_id": "abcdef1234567890",
      "catalog": "main",
      "schema": "default"
    }
  }
}
```

### PostgreSQL / Redshift

```json
{
  "warehouses": {
    "postgres-dev": {
      "type": "postgres",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 5432,
      "database": "analytics",
      "user": "analyst",
      "password": "${PG_PASSWORD}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Project-level config

Place `.altimate-code/altimate-code.json` in your dbt project root for project-specific settings:

```
my-dbt-project/
  .altimate-code/
    altimate-code.json    # warehouse connections, model preferences
    agents/               # custom agent prompts
    commands/             # custom slash commands
    plugins/              # custom plugins
  models/
  dbt_project.yml
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` | Snowflake password (referenced in config as `${SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}`) |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | Databricks PAT |
| `ALTIMATE_CLI_CONFIG` | Custom config file path |

## Using with Claude Code

altimate works as a standalone agent, but you can also invoke it from within Claude Code sessions. Claude Code can call altimate's tools when working on data projects:

```bash
# In Claude Code, use the /data skill to route to altimate
/data "analyze the cost of our top 10 most expensive queries"
```

## Using with Codex

If you have a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription, you can use Codex as your LLM backend at no additional API cost:

1. Run `/connect` in the TUI
2. Select **Codex** as your provider
3. Authenticate via browser OAuth
4. Your subscription covers all usage — no API keys needed

## Verify your setup

```

```

## Example Prompts

Copy and paste these into the TUI to get started with common use cases:

### Cost analysis

```
Analyze our Snowflake credit consumption over the last 30 days. Show the top 10 most expensive queries, which warehouses they ran on, and suggest optimizations.
```

### dbt model generation

```
Create a dbt staging model for the raw_orders table in our Snowflake warehouse. Include column descriptions, a unique test on order_id, and a not_null test on customer_id.
```

### SQL anti-pattern review

```
Scan all SQL files in the models/ directory for anti-patterns. Flag any SELECT *, missing WHERE clauses on DELETE statements, implicit cartesian joins, and non-sargable predicates.
```

### Cross-warehouse migration

```
Translate the following Snowflake SQL to BigQuery-compatible SQL, noting any function differences, data type changes, and features that don't have a direct equivalent:
SELECT DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()), TRY_TO_NUMBER(amount), ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT category) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY category) FROM sales QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY sale_date DESC) = 1;
```

### Data quality validation

```
Generate data quality tests for all models in the marts/ directory. For each model, suggest unique tests, not-null tests, accepted-values tests, and relationship tests based on the column names and types.
```
