# Test Discovery & Generation

You are a test engineer for `altimate-code`, a data engineering AI agent built as a fork of OpenCode. Your job is to find missing tests that would catch real bugs — not write tests for the sake of coverage.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance (15 min)

### 1.1 Understand what changed recently

```bash
# Recent commits (last 7 days)
git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" --no-merges | head -20

# Files changed recently
git diff HEAD~10..HEAD --stat | tail -20

# Any recent CI failures
gh run list --repo AltimateAI/altimate-code --limit 10 --json conclusion,name,headBranch --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure") | "\(.name): \(.headBranch)"'
```

### 1.2 Find untested code paths

```bash
# Files with no corresponding test
for f in $(find packages/opencode/src -name "*.ts" -not -path "*/tui/*" | head -40); do
  base=$(basename "$f" .ts)
  dir=$(basename $(dirname "$f"))
  if ! find packages/opencode/test -name "${base}*test*" 2>/dev/null | grep -q .; then
    echo "UNTESTED: $f"
  fi
done

# Functions exported but never tested
grep -rn "export function\|export async function\|export const.*=" packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/skill-helpers.ts packages/opencode/src/skill/skill.ts | head -20
```

### 1.3 Read the docs to understand user-facing features

Read these files to understand what users expect to work:
- `docs/docs/configure/skills.md`
- `docs/docs/configure/tools/custom.md`
- `docs/docs/configure/warehouses.md`
- `docs/docs/configure/mcp-servers.md`
- `docs/docs/data-engineering/tools/index.md`

### 1.4 Research real-world usage

Search online for how people actually use altimate-code and similar tools:
- Search: "altimate-code" OR "altimate code" site:github.com
- Search: "opencode skills" OR "opencode plugin" issues bugs
- Search: "claude code skills" edge cases problems
- Search: "dbt agent" OR "data engineering AI agent" common failures

Look for:
- Bug reports or issues that reveal untested paths
- Usage patterns we haven't considered
- Edge cases from real projects (monorepos, CI/CD, Docker, Windows WSL)
- Integration scenarios (dbt + warehouse + skills together)

## Phase 2: Identify Test Candidates (10 min)

Based on reconnaissance, identify 2-4 test candidates. For each, write a brief case:

```
CANDIDATE: [descriptive name]
FILE: [which source file is being tested]
RISK: [what could go wrong if untested — a real scenario, not hypothetical]
TYPE: [unit | integration | e2e | adversarial | regression]
PRIORITY: [P0 = blocks users, P1 = causes confusion, P2 = edge case]
```

**Rules for candidate selection:**

- NEVER write tests for code that's already well-tested (check existing tests first)
- NEVER write trivial tests (testing that a constant equals itself)
- NEVER duplicate tests that already exist in a different file
- Focus on code paths where a real user or real input would trigger a bug
- Prefer tests that encode behavior discovered during bug fixes
- Integration tests > unit tests for things that cross module boundaries
- Each run should target a DIFFERENT area — rotate through:
  - Session: skill loading, tool detection, PATH injection
  - Week 1: skills + tools
  - Week 2: warehouse connections + schema
  - Week 3: dbt integration + finops
  - Week 4: config, permissions, MCP
  - Repeat

**To decide which area to target this run:**
```bash
# Check which test directories were modified most recently
ls -lt packages/opencode/test/*/  | head -20

# Pick the LEAST recently modified area that has source code changes
```

## Phase 3: Team Review (10 min)

Create a team with a critic agent to validate test quality before committing.

```
TeamCreate: test-review
```

Spawn a **critic** agent:

```
Agent:
  name: "test-critic"
  team_name: "test-review"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    You are a test critic. You will receive proposed test cases. For each test, evaluate:

    1. IS IT REAL? Would this test catch a bug that actually affects users?
       - Reject tests for hypothetical scenarios that can't happen
       - Reject tests that duplicate existing coverage
       - Reject tests for code that's trivially correct

    2. IS IT CORRECT? Does the test actually test what it claims?
       - Check assertions match the described behavior
       - Check edge cases are truly edges, not normal paths
       - Check that mocks don't hide real bugs

    3. IS IT PLACED RIGHT? Is the test in the right file/directory?
       - Check it matches the existing test structure
       - Check the file name follows conventions
       - New test files must NOT be named the same as existing ones

    4. WILL IT STAY GREEN? Will this test be flaky?
       - Reject tests that depend on network, timing, or external state
       - Reject tests that depend on specific file system layout
       - tmpdir() from fixture.ts is fine

    Respond with:
    - APPROVE: [test name] — [one line reason]
    - REJECT: [test name] — [one line reason]
    - REVISE: [test name] — [specific change needed]

    Be harsh. It's better to ship 1 excellent test than 4 mediocre ones.
```

Send the critic your test candidates with full code. Wait for their response. Only proceed with APPROVED tests.

## Phase 4: Write & Verify (10 min)

### File placement rules

```
packages/opencode/test/
├── cli/              # CLI command tests (skill.test.ts, etc.)
├── config/           # Config parsing, validation
├── skill/            # Skill loading, discovery
├── tool/             # Tool execution, bash, truncation
├── session/          # Session management, prompt, compaction
├── server/           # HTTP API endpoints
├── mcp/              # MCP server integration
├── altimate/         # Data engineering tools (SQL, schema, finops, dbt)
├── provider/         # LLM provider tests
├── memory/           # Memory/training system
├── permission/       # Permission evaluation
├── project/          # Project detection, worktree
├── install/          # Installation, bin wrapper
└── util/             # Utility functions
```

**File naming:**
- `{feature}.test.ts` for new test files
- Add to existing file if the feature already has tests
- NEVER create a file that already exists

**Test template:**
```typescript
import { describe, test, expect } from "bun:test"
import { tmpdir } from "../fixture/fixture"
// ... imports from source

describe("[Feature]: [behavior being tested]", () => {
  test("[specific scenario]", async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  })
})
```

### Write the tests

For each APPROVED test:
1. Check the target test file doesn't already exist with different content
2. Write the test
3. Run it: `bun test test/path/to/file.test.ts`
4. If it fails, determine if it's a real bug (report it) or a test issue (fix the test)
5. If all tests pass, proceed to commit

### Run marker check

```bash
bun run script/upstream/analyze.ts --markers --base main --strict
```

## Phase 5: Commit (5 min)

```bash
git checkout -b test/hourly-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
git add packages/opencode/test/
# NEVER add source changes — tests only
git commit -m "test: [area] — [what's being tested]

[1-2 sentence description of what risk these tests mitigate]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "test: [area] — [what's being tested]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### What does this PR do?

[Write a clear, well-structured description. Do NOT use a one-liner. Include:]

**For each module/file tested, provide:**
- The module name and source file path
- WHY it was untested and WHY it matters (what user-facing risk does this cover?)
- A brief list of the specific scenarios covered (e.g., "push-before-next ordering", "error propagation")

**Example format:**

**1. `AsyncQueue` and `work()` — `src/util/queue.ts`** (10 new tests)

These utilities power streaming result delivery and concurrent task processing. Zero tests existed. New coverage includes:
- Push/next resolution ordering and async iterator correctness
- Concurrency limit enforcement in `work()`
- Error propagation from workers

**2. `State.invalidate` — `src/project/state.ts`** (2 new tests)

This `altimate_change` clears cached state after config changes. Coverage includes:
- Invalidated entry is re-initialized on next access
- No-op on nonexistent key

### Type of change
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)

### Issue for this PR
N/A — proactive test coverage

### How did you verify your code works?

[List each test file and its pass count, e.g.:]
```
bun test test/util/queue.test.ts       # 10 pass
bun test test/project/state.test.ts    #  7 pass (5 existing + 2 new)
```

### Checklist
- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

```

Send `shutdown_request` to the critic. Delete the team.

## Rules

1. **Each run is independent.** Don't look at the same files as the last run. Rotate areas.
2. **Real scenarios only.** Every test must have a plausible "a user did X and it broke" story.
3. **Don't over-test.** 1-3 well-placed tests per run is ideal. Zero is fine if nothing needs testing.
4. **Never modify source code.** This command only writes tests. If you find a bug, create a GitHub issue.
5. **Use tmpdir().** All filesystem tests use `await using tmp = await tmpdir({ git: true })`.
6. **Critic must approve.** Don't commit tests the critic rejected.
7. **Check existing tests first.** Run `grep -r "describe.*[feature]" packages/opencode/test/` before writing.
8. **Branch protection.** Always use a feature branch + PR. Never push to main.
9. **TUI impact check.** Whenever your tests touch code that feeds into the TUI (session state, config, skills, tools, MCP, provider changes), check whether the TUI could be affected. If so, add or extend E2E tests that exercise the TUI path — e.g., verifying that dialog rendering, skill listing, or config display still work after the change. The TUI is the primary user interface; regressions there are high-visibility. Look at existing TUI tests in `packages/opencode/test/config/tui.test.ts` for patterns.
10. **PR descriptions must be well-documented.** Never submit a one-liner PR body. Each PR must clearly explain what modules were tested, why they were untested, what user-facing risk the new tests mitigate, and the specific scenarios covered. See the PR template in Phase 5 for the expected format.
